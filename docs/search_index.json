This approach, which has been proposed or imposed by some utilities in high-cost states like California and New York, will disproportionately affect low-usage customers who are already energy-efficient. As a result, these customers will have no motivation to invest in electrification.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYs:\n\n• Low-usage customers, particularly those who are frugal or energy-efficient, may be penalized by the shift to fixed charges, as their bills will increase despite consuming less electricity.\n• High-usage customers already face high bills and may not see a significant reduction, making them less motivated to invest in electrification that would further raise their bills.\n• Medium-usage customers will likely experience no change in their bills and will have no incentive to invest in electrification, as the benefits of reduced energy costs do not materialize for them.",
