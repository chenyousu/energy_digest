      "published_iso": "2025-11-07T16:16:55",
      "summary": "The article proposes a coherency control strategy for Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) to establish coherence among power system devices. This control enforces an output current with a proportional magnitude and constant phase shift relative to a reference, making it technology-agnostic. Case studies demonstrate its potential to improve damping and overall dynamic behavior in modern power systems.",
